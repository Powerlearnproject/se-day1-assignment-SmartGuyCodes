#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

a. What is software engineering?

- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It involves a structured approach to designing, creating, testing, and managing software systems to meet specific requirements. The discipline encompasses various methodologies, tools, and practices aimed at producing high-quality software that is reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

b. Importance of Software Engineering

- Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare

c. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Development of programming languages
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- The advent of programming in the 1970s
- The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

d. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
- Implementation: writing code and building software according to the design specifications
- Testing: Conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
- Deploying: Releasing the software to customers and users
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

e. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

- Waterfall and Agile are two widely used software development methodologies, each with its own approach to managing projects.
- Here is a comparison of the two:

    - Approach: Waterfall is linear and sequential. Agile is iterative and incremental
    - Flexibility: Waterfall is not flexible because it's dificult to accomodate changes. Agile is very flexible because it embraces changes, even late in the process
    - Documentation: Waterfall documentation is extensive and upfront. Agile documentation is minimal with focus on working software
    - User involvement: In waterfall, user involvement is limited after the initial requirements phase. Agile has a continuous involvement and feedback
    - Testing: In waterfall, testing is performed after implementation whereas in agile, testing is integrated throughout the development process
    - Delivery: In waterfall, there is a single delivery at the end of the project. In agile, there is always frequent deliveries of software
    - Risk management: In waterfall, risks can be identified early but hard to address late whereas, in agile there is a continuous risk management with each iteration
    - Team structure: Waterfall is hierarchical while in agile team structure is cross-functional and collaborative
- Usage examples:
    - Startup Product Development: Agile is ideal for startups where product requirements are expected to evolve rapidly based on user feedback.
    - Construction of Mission-Critical Systems: Projects like building medical devices or aerospace systems, where requirements are clear, and thorough documentation and compliance are essential. Waterfall works for such.

f. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- Software developer: Responsible for writing code and executing tests
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
- Project manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects
- System architect: Designs the overall structure and architect of software systems
- UI/UX Designer: Creates user interfaces and designs user experiences for software applications
