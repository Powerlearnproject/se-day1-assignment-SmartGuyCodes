#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

a. What is software engineering?

- Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It involves a structured approach to designing, creating, testing, and managing software systems to meet specific requirements. The discipline encompasses various methodologies, tools, and practices aimed at producing high-quality software that is reliable, scalable, and maintainable.

b. Importance of Software Engineering

- Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare

c. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

- Development of programming languages
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- The advent of programming in the 1970s
- The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

d. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
- Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
- Implementation: writing code and building software according to the design specifications
- Testing: Conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements
- Deploying: Releasing the software to customers and users
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment
